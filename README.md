'Twas brillig and the slithy toves did gyre and gimble in the wabe,
All mimsy were the borogroves, and the mome raths outgrabe

Beware the Jabberwock, my son; the jaws that bite, the claws that snatch
Beware the Jubjub bird and shun the Frumious Bandersnatch!

He took his vorpal sword in hand: Long time the manxome foe he sought
So rested he by the Tumtum tree, and stood a while in thought.

As in offish thought he stood, The Jabberwock, with eyes of flame,
Came whiffling through the tulgey wood, and burbled as it came! 

One, two! One, two! And through and through the vorpal blade went snicker-snack!
He left it dead, and with its head he went galumphing back. 

And has though slain the Jabberwock? Come to my arms, my beamish boy! 
O frabjous day! Callooh! Callay! He chortled in his joy.
